One Love
========

### Overview
One Love is WEB frontend which binds [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) roles which are shared via [Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/), hosting providers APIs and [Docker Compose] (https://docs.docker.com/compose/) into powerful interface which controls all aspects of the cloud infrastracture.

The idea is to create software which is able to manage multiple hosting providers which all have multiple hosts on them. You can put hosts into groups and apply roles based on those groups, for easier management of large number of machines.
